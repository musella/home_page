This is Home_P@age. A simple PHP based class to build personal home page. 

The project is very immature. I am distibuting the code 'as is' with the hope that it may be useful to someone.

* The page content can be written in Markdown.
* Pages are added to the website by creating a markdown file in the content directory.
* Side content can be specified in the index.php file. Currently, the following type of side content can be added:
  * Bookmarks
  * RSS/Atom feeds (using the SimplePie parser)
  * Markdown pages
